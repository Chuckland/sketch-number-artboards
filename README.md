# sketch-number-artboards
Simple plug-in for Sketch to number artboards.

## How it works

### Only number
Add number to artboard name. Number is chosen by artboard location on the canvas. If artboard name already has a number, plugin refreshes it.

For example: artboard with name "Screen" becomes "01. Screen". If same style number presents in artboard name, it will be replaced.
